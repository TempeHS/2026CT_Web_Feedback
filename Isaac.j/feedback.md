## HTML Structure & Semantics

**Strengths:**

- Good use of semantic HTML5 elements and Bootstrap grid for layout.
- Template inheritance with `layout.html` and use of partials for reusable components.
- Jinja2 blocks and includes are used appropriately for structure.

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Add more ARIA attributes and alt text for images to improve accessibility.
- Ensure all forms and interactive elements are properly labeled for screen readers.

---

## CSS Design & Styling

## Flask Implementation

**Strengths:**

- Well-structured routes for each page, clearly defined in `main.py`.
- Data passed to templates using Jinja2 for loops and variable rendering.
