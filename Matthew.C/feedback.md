## HTML Structure and Semantics

Matthew, your web design project shows a solid understanding of HTML structure. You have organized your templates well and used semantic elements to make your pages clear and accessible. Using template inheritance and partials helps keep your code maintainable. For future improvement, consider adding more ARIA attributes and descriptive alt text to images to further enhance accessibility.

## CSS Design and Styling

Your CSS is well-organized, and you have made good use of Bootstrap components for layout and styling. The custom styles for cards, buttons, and navigation show creativity and attention to detail. Responsive design is implemented effectively, making your site usable on different devices. To take your styling further, experiment with custom color schemes and transitions to give your site a unique look and feel.

## Flask Implementation

Your Flask application is well-structured, with clear routes for each page and logical separation of templates. You use Jinja2 features like loops and includes to render dynamic content, which is excellent for a first web project. Error handling and validation could be improved by adding feedback for invalid form submissions and handling missing data gracefully. Try adding more comments to your Python code to explain your logic and help future development.

## User Experience and Functionality

Navigation across your web design project is intuitive, and the use of interactive features like forms and galleries adds value for users. Content is well-organized, and the inclusion of different page types makes your site informative. For further improvement, consider adding confirmation messages for form submissions and interactive elements such as tooltips or modals to guide users through your site.

## Technical Implementation

You have developed a comprehensive web design project with multiple unique pages and features. Your project structure is efficient, with assets and templates organized in logical folders. To further enhance your technical skills, try implementing user authentication or saving form data to a database. This will help you build even more interactive and useful web applications in the future.
