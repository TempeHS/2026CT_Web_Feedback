## HTML Structure and Semantics

Douglas, your web design project shows a good start with the use of HTML templates. You use semantic elements and template inheritance, which helps keep your code organized and maintainable. For future improvement, consider adding more ARIA attributes and descriptive alt text to images to further enhance accessibility.

## CSS Design and Styling

Your CSS implementation demonstrates creativity. You use Bootstrap components for layout and responsive design, and custom styles for navbar, carousel images, and card row padding add visual interest. To take your styling further, experiment with advanced CSS features such as transitions or hover effects for interactivity, and organize custom CSS into sections with comments for easier maintenance.

## Flask Implementation

You have set up Flask routes and templates, which is a strong foundation. Data is passed to templates using Jinja2 for loops and variable rendering, and you separate concerns between backend and frontend. To improve, add error handling for invalid routes or missing data, and consider implementing form validation for user input on contact pages. Adding comments to your Python code will help future development.

## User Experience and Functionality

Navigation is clear, and your project is easy to use. Interactive features like embedded maps enhance engagement, and content is well-organized. For further improvement, add more interactive elements, such as modals or tooltips, and ensure all links and buttons are clearly labeled and accessible.

## Technical Implementation

Your project includes several unique pages and features, showing good effort. You organize files efficiently with separate folders for CSS, images, and templates, and use template inheritance and reusable components. To further improve, document custom scripts and components for easier future updates, and review file naming conventions for consistency.
